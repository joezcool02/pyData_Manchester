# pyData Manchester
Welcome to PyData Manchester, the local chapter of PyData foundation. The PyData community gathers to discuss how best to apply Python tools, as well as other tools and languages, to meet evolving challenges in data management, processing, analytics, and visualization.

# Pandas Data Dive (May 2018)
### where 
Madlab Manchester NQ

### when
1st May 18:30

### what
Apologies that this month we could not get a wheelchair accessible venue.

Pandas is an easy to use set of data structures and data analysis tools which is fundamental in a Python Data Science toolkit, so we thougyht it would be a good focus for our first meetup. This meetup will primarily be a data dive so bring a laptop if you can, if you don't be prepared to pair!

From talks in the community we have realised that everybody has great meetup ideas and we want to provide some of the variety that people are hoping for, this months will be a data dive, but look forward to some more uniquely structured meetups in future months. We are open to any ideas. We really just want to develop the data science community as a place where we can all learn. Looking forward to seeing you all!

### What do I need to do before the meetup?

#### installing pandas
In order to save on time before the meetup, make sure you have some version of pandas working on your machine before we get started. To those of you familiar with pip for python this is should be trivial.

Installing pandas can be a little difficult for inexperienced users.
The simplest way to install not only pandas, but Python and the most popular packages that make up the SciPy stack is with Anaconda, a cross-platform Python distribution for data analytics and scientific computing. [Install here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/)

#### the data
We have three datasets suitable for varying levels of experience:
* The famous [Iris dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris)
* The [National Crime dataset](https://data.police.uk/data/)
* Generated syntehtic eCommerce type data (???)
